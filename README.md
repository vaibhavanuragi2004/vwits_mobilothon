Overview
This project implements an advanced AI-driven system for road safety, theft prevention, and accident response using cutting-edge technologies like DSRC (Dedicated Short-Range Communication), NLP, and IoT-enabled geofencing. It integrates Generative AI and VoIP systems to provide real-time alerts and emergency assistance, aiming to reduce accidents, theft, and response delays.
Features
Geofencing for Theft Prevention:

Defines virtual boundaries around vehicles.
Detects unauthorized movements using GPS and sends real-time alerts.
Implements remote vehicle lockdown for enhanced security.
Accident Response System:

Uses accelerometers and gyroscopes to detect crashes.
AI evaluates accident severity in real-time.
Sends automated VoIP calls to emergency services with location and severity details.
Smart Traffic Communication:

DSRC-enabled communication for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) messaging.
Hazard alerts for drivers and pedestrians.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Frameworks and Libraries:
Firebase Admin SDK (Push Notifications)
Twilio API (VoIP Calls)
NumPy (Accident Severity Analysis)
APIs:
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Twilio Programmable Voice
AI Models:
Accident Severity Analysis (TensorFlow/NumPy-based custom model)


Future Scope
Extend DSRC integration for autonomous vehicles.
Leverage predictive analytics for hazard forecasting.
Scale accident response system to support multilingual VoIP calls.
